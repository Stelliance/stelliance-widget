# AngularElementApp

Angular element app example.
Build an angular application into a generic web component that can be uses in any html page.

## Development server

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
An `output.js` file will be created in `dist` folder and can be used in any html page (no extra files are needed)

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Serve locally the generic web component

If you need to see the render of the web component locally you can run `npm run preview:serve`.
